# Burning Machine - Front-end Application

This is the readme file for a front-end application built using React. The application recreates an analog machine where users can burn tokens in exchange for an NFT (Non-Fungible Token). Although it does not currently interact with any blockchain, it provides two programmed actions: burn and print.




## Features

- **Analog Machine Simulation:** The front-end application faithfully replicates the look and feel of an analog machine.
- **Token Burning:** Users can trigger the burn action by entering the code`#01#` into the machine. This simulates the burning of tokens.
- NFT Printing: Users can trigger the print action by entering the code `#02#`into the machine. This simulates the printing of an NFT.
- **React Components:** The application is built using React, utilizing components for modularity and reusability.
- **Styling with Sass:** The styling is implemented using Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), allowing for more maintainable and organized CSS code.

## Dependencies

The Burning Machine front-end application has the following dependencies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- React DOM: A package for working with the DOM (Document Object Model) in React applications.

- Sass: A CSS preprocessor that enhances CSS functionality with variables, mixins, and more.

To install the dependencies, navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command:


```bash
npm install
```
## Usage

To run the front-end application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the development server and opens the application in your default web browser.
## Project Structure
The project structure of this React app is organized as follows:

- **src:** The root directory of the project.
- **src/components:** Contains reusable components used throughout the application.
- **src/components/ui:** Holds UI-specific components, such as buttons, input fields, or navigation bars.
- **src/layouts:** Contains layout components that define the overall structure of different pages or sections of the application.
- **src/resources:** Includes static resources, such as images, icons, ...
- **src/styles:** Holds global styles and SASS files used for styling components.

The project structure is designed to promote code organization and maintainability. By separating components into different directories, it becomes easier to locate and manage specific parts of the application. The src/resources directory provides a dedicated location for storing static assets, ensuring a clear separation between code and resources.
